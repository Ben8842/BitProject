For educational puposes I am looking to use the coinlib.io api to display things in interesting ways.  

This project also uses the chart.js to help generate charts.  
This project also uses https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/ for pulling the latest news information

API KEY IS 56a2275998bf3767


    "Powered by Coinlib API"
    https://coinlib.io/apidocs


    
120 requests/hour to /global
60 requests/hour to /coinlist
180 requests/hour to /coin


All API endpoints are under https://coinlib.io/api/v1. Use GET to access the API.
EXAMPLE: https://coinlib.io/api/v1/global?key=56a2275998bf3767&pref=EUR
