For educational puposes I am looking to use the various API's to build a website

This project uses the chart.js to help generate charts.  

This project uses https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/ for pulling the latest news information and price data and more

This project uses https://coinlib.io/apidocs for price data and more

This project uses https://www.coingecko.com/api for price data and more
